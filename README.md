Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office

Apply the foundational skills in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python courses to manipulate and visualize movie and TV data.

About the project

This is a guided project from Datacamp to apply the skills learned in the courses "Introduction to Python" and "Intermediate Python". In this project I will conduct an exploratory data analysis on the Netflix dataset by manipulating the data to get insights from the data through visualization using Matplotlib.

Tasks performed in the project:

1. Loading friend's data into a dictionary
2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
3. A visual inspection of our data
4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV
5. Filtering for movies!
6. Creating a scatter plot
7. Digging deeper
8. Marking non-feature films
9. Plotting with color!
10. What next?
